DSA Visualizer Mini Project
===========================

This project, "DSA Visualizer," is a college mini-project that provides a visual representation of basic sorting and searching algorithms. It offers a user-friendly interface to interact with and control the visualization, making it a valuable learning tool for students studying data structures and algorithms.

Features
--------

-   Visualization of basic sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.).
-   Visualization of basic searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.).
-   Step-by-step visualization to help understand the working of algorithms.

Technologies Used
-----------------

-   HTML
-   SCSS
-   JavaScript
-   Node.js (for server-side functionality and deployment if needed)

Enjoy exploring and learning from the DSA Visualizer!
